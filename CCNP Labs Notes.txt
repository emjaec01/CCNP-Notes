YT Notes

Task1:
Two rules of routing:
R1: Ping DIKIT: only direct neighbors ping/connect- devices will ping if same wire! or same VLAN!
R2: to Ping not DIKI: you need Routing! 

use alias - most cli command that we need to get used to.

sh ip route connected | inc C 
	- to check the connected route that will be needed in routing.

Task2:
how to check if eigrp is running:
show ip eigrp traffic
show ip eigrp topology
show ip route eigrp
sho ip protocols

Task3:
Why do we need so many areas: for every area you can have a maximum of 50 routers
**clear ip ospf process before pasting
 
1. create your areas: =0 backbone:
2. create loopback for stability test
3. router ospf [process-id]: range 1-2,000,000

int lo0
	ip add 4.4.4.4 255.255.255.255
router ospf 1
10.1.1.8/30

how to check if ospf is working:
sh ip ospf database
sh ip ospf neighbor
sh ip route ospf
